# Grid practice
 
Practicing creating websites with Grid based stuff from scratch. Following an youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o&t=1942s

Another good Grid crash course can be found from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o

Point is to learn using Grid and utilize it better. Hopefully well enough to be able to make a Xmash calender for present next Christmas.
